# Eat-Da Burger
Restaurant app that lets users input the type of burgers they like to eat, using MySQL, Node, Express, Handlebars, and an ORM.
<br>

Upon page load, users will be greeted with the following page:
![Eat-Da-Burger homepage](public/assets/img/burger-homepage.png)
(Values in the 'Burgers that have not been eaten' and 'Burgers that have been devoured' may vary)
<br>

In the "Add a Burger" section, users can enter a burger name into the input field, and click "Add Burger to add a burger to the database. The burger will be added to the list of burgers that have not been eaten.
<br>

Users may also click the "Eat it." button to the right of any burger in the list of burgers that have not been eaten to "devour" the burger. Once clicked, the burger will be moved to the "Burgers that have been devoured" section. When a burger is moved to that section, the burger may not be moved back to the other column, as, with a real burger, you cannot un-eat a burger.
